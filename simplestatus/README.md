Designed as an example for use with the **autologin** script, this adds a simple program that runs automatically once the **autologin** user logs in, that regularly displays some system statistics. 

## How?

Copy all of the files in **files** to **/home/autologin** - and add **./start.sh** to the end of **/home/autologin/.profile**. Or just run **install.sh** to do it for you (as root from any user, to make sure it has the permissions)
