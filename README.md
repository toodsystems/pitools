# pitools
Tools for doing various things with Raspberry Pi's. All of these target Raspbian unless mentioned otherwise.

Please see the documentation for each individual tool, do not blindly use them as some may damage data if used incorrectly or cause unwanted side effects.

## sd_to_usb_boot

* Moves your existing Raspberry Pi installation from the SD card to an attached USB device automatically, and configures it to run from the USB device rather than the SD card. The SD card is still required.
